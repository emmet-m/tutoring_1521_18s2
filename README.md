# COMP1521 Tutorial work repository

## How to use this repository

Each folder contains the relevant week's excersizes! You can download the entire repository via the green "Clone or Download" button. Click it and select "Download ZIP" to download a zip file of everything. You can unzip this file on CSE with the command `unzip tutoring_1911.zip` on the command line.

If you know how to use git, you can just clone the respository.

If you don't want to download anything, you can just view the code online by clicking on each folder.

## Where are the questions for each code file?

You can find them on [WEBCMS3](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP1521/18s2/resources/19194).

## This program doesn't work! There are some programs missing!

Not all the programs are finished! Some are broken purely to demonstrate a concept (e.g. error checking, signal handling).

Want working copies of broken programs here? Try and fix them yourself! :)

If you want the full solutions, check WEBCMS3 later on when official solutions are posted. The purpose of these programs is so you have a copy of what we did in class! :)
